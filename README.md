# smart-threat-alert-system-using-IoT
Internet of things(IoT) is governing the era of modern security systems with the implementation of cloud
connectivity to the security devices. In recent years, IoT has been
a focus of research. The security systems have been implemented
efficiently with the help of IoT. IoT keeps the security devices
connected and provide stable interconnection between them. Our
proposed system combines the features of an Alert System and IoT
to provide a less expensive and smarter alert system in emergency
situations. It uses the Radio Frequency (RF) detectors to detect the
unique combination of RF signals emitted by easily available RF
transmitters. Processing of signals and generation of alerts is done
with the help of Raspberry Pi. This will be a less expensive and
easy to implement system.
